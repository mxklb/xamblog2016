My first day in Prachuap Khiri Khan started some kind of formal. I wanted to extend my visa. Normal tourists visa for germans last 4 weeks. For 50 EUR it can be easily extended to another 4 weeks. So I need to go to the immigration office at the border to Myanmar, which is like 20 km from here. Because there is no public transportation and tuk tuk is to expensive I rented a scooter. Nice experience, driving left and never drove one before ;) First I ended up in nowheresland and turned round.. After like 1.5 hours driving I got my visa extended. On my way back I slowly checked out some spots at the coast near Prachuap (National Marine Park)

Back in Prachuap I drove up the coast north and got to a nice fisher village. There is a viewpoint up in the hills, I'll check out some other day, to be continued..
