Today we traveled from Ko Tao back to Chumphon to stay here for two nights. We're located 16 km away from town center at Hat Thung Wua Laen. It's more a thai holiday area than a western tourists spot. So it's less crowded and far more quiet than Ko Tao. Our bungalows are directly in front of the nearly empty beach..
