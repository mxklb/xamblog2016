Yesterday me and Aline did a snorkling daytrip to Surin Island. A national park "near" Ko Phayam. The speed boat ride was god damn hard, the driver pushed it to maximum, sitting in front was not possible. 

Nevertheless, the snorkling was totally awesome. We had cristal clear water and sunny weather, perfect conditions. We saw a lot of corals, a billion of colored fish and I saw three sharks of like 1.5 meters size. Sadly I don't have a waterproof camera - next time snorkling in such great area I'll definitely look forward to buy some under water filming equipment in advance.

Today I'm leaving Ko Phayam to get the night bus to Bangkok. This is the final image showing the peer during my departure.
