title: Surat Thani Stop Over
---

Actually I'm traveling north. I took a bus from Krabi to Surat Thani and stayed there for one night. Surat Thani is a really busy industrial thai city. It looked dirty and hectic, so it's more a stop over than a tourist attraction. Nevertheless the hotel I had was quite good...
