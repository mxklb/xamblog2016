Today I rented a scooter again to explore Ko Phayam on my own. This must really be paradise! Check out some of my impressions.

This is the south end of Buffalo Bay, "Ao Khao Kwai". A nice mangrove forest.

A little bit more north behind the mangroves.

All in all this was a totally amazing day. The landscapes on Buffalo Bay are more differing as on "Ao Yai". I'm absolutely flashed being here on this beautiful paradise island..
