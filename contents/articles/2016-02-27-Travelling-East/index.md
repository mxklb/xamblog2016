Today we took a minivan from Chumphon to Ranong to directly hop on a slow boat ferry to Ko Phayam. We had cloudy weather and some rain during our journey. Hopefully the weather continues to be sunny for our last week island experience, fingers crossed...

Here you see some photos taken during travelling. This is a random Ranong street shot,
