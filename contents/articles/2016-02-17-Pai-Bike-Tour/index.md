We did an awesome trekking to the Mae Yen Waterfall. It was a full day hike through the jungle with really amazing views, sounds and river crossing trails. Finally we had a shower under the waterfall. The whole tour took us about 8 hours, including a good nearly lonely picnic at the waterfall. Happily we got back out of the jungle nearly during sunset, perfect timing..
