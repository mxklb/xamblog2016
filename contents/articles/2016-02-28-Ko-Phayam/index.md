This is Palmbeach Bungalows where we actually stay. The bungalow owner "Yuppie" is one of the best 'Herbergsvaters' and cooks I've ever had. The hut in the middle - the one behind the tree - is ours for the next few days.

It is the last accommodation at the south east end of Koh Phayam. The so called Long Beach, "Ao Yai".
